## Excel Export

TruBudget now features the possibility to export all the data visible to one user into an Excel Workbook. This feature is enabled through a new service that needs to be started separately. If you want to know how to start the service, please see the [tutorials](../../tutorials) section.

### Exporting Data

To export the TruBudget data:

1. Click on the hamburger menu on the top left corner to open the side menu
2. Select "Export" - the Excel file containing the TruBudget data is automatically downloaded and saved to your local drive
