# TruBudget Blockchain

This project encapsulates the Multichain implementation for Trubudget. It can be seen as the data tier in Trubudget

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-set `docker-compose` cluster which starts the whole TruBudget application (that means you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)). It uses the local build of the blockchain and the alpha-deployments of the TruBudget API and Frontend. The pre-set cluster contains:

- 1 Alpha-Node + 1 Beta-Node
- 1 Alpha API connected to Alpha-Node
- 1 Frontend connected to Alpha-API

Since the required docker images are located in the private Docker registry you need to authenticate.

To do so you simply create a login token by `$ echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD > DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

If you have set your password token you can simply start the cluster `$ ./start-service.sh`

Enjoy!

## Configuration

The Blockchain node is fully configured through environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Depending on the Trubudget setup environment variables

Every beta node needs to use the same RPC password in order to be able to connect to the blockchain. <br/>**Hint:** Although the RPC_PASSWORD is not required it is highly recommended to set an own secure one                          |

| EXPOSE_MC    | no       | false         | If set to true, Trubudget tries to expose it's multichain via kubernetes' ingress. First a kubernetes config file is searched in `/.kube/config`. If not found and the MC is deployed in a cluster, it is search for the service account to get the information. After configuration the `externalip` arg is set to the ip of the service' ingress of the configured cluster SERVICE_NAME and NAMESPACE are required to access the ingress of the service. |
| SERVICE_NAME | no       |               | This variable is only required if EXPOSE_MC is set to true. It defines which service the kubernetes client should search for in the configured kubernetes cluster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| NAMESPACE    | no       |               | This variable is only required if EXPOSE_MC is set to true. It defines in which namespace the kubernetes client should search for the given service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Lifecycle

As described before: The Trubudget Blockchain is created one by an alpha, which then grants beta access on demand.

1.  Start Alpha-Node of Trubudget Blockchain (Alpha sets chain configurations for network and has admit privileges)
1.  Start API (Alpha-API)
1.  API will set up Alpha-Node for Trubudget (creating Admin-Streams)
1.  Start beta-Node(s)
1.  Beta-Node will try to join the network by connection to the alpha-node
    1.  If mutual authentication is enabled, the blockchain can only request to access the network when providing a valid certificate. In case the certificate is not valid, the Alpha API will reject the node immediately
1.  Beta-Node attempt to access the network will be rejected because they have not be granted access
1.  Beta-Node requests to be granted access to the network by sending its blockchain-address and information about the Organization operating the node to the Alpha-API
1.  Eventually, Alpha-API grants read/write (not admin) access to the network for the supplied address
1.  Beta-Node retries to join the network
1.  Beta-Node is granted access and synchronized blockchain data

## Alpha vs. Beta Node

Trubudget is a private Blockchain (BC) network. That means an Alpha need to give new nodes (betas) a one-time grant in order to access the network. The decision if I want to spawn an Alpha or a Beta node is simple:

- Alpha node: I want to create a new network
- Beta node: I want to participate on an existing network

## Mutual Authentication

Mutual Authentication is a feature that ensures that only nodes with a valid certificate can access the network.
A node, which wants to access the network, has to authenticate itself against the Alpha API with a valid certificate.
If the certificate is not valid, the API will reject the request. If the certificate is valid, the API will accept the connection and the user can approve the connection.
