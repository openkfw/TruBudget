## Architecture Decisions

When we make a significant decision in how to write code, or how to maintain the
project and what we can or cannot support, we will document it using [Architecture
Decision Records (ADR)]. Take a look at the [doc/architecture/decisions] directory for
existings ADRs. If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is
documented there. If it is _not_ documented there, please ask us - chances are you're
not the only one wondering. Of course, also feel free to challenge the decisions by
starting a discussion on [Gitter] or by opening a [new GitHub issue].

## Source Layout

Best practices and layout is documented in README files next to the source files they
describe. For example, take a look at [api/src/](api/src/) to get started.
