### Frontend

For details see [Frontend environment variables](../frontend/README.md#excel-export-service).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-set [`docker-compose`](./docker-compose.yaml) cluster which starts the whole TruBudget application including the excel export project (that means you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)).
The pre-set cluster contains:

- 1 Alpha-Node
- 1 Alpha API connected to Alpha-Node
- 1 Frontend connected to Alpha-API
- 1 Excel-export service

To check what is configurable regarding excel-export service check out the [environment variables section](#environment-variables)
