# TruBudget Operation Setup

This setup helps operation teams to setup TruBudget in an easy way with a pre-configured `.env` file.

## Getting started

To setup TruBudget, you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) (version 20.10.7 or higher) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (version 1.29.2 or higher).

First, to make sure the `.env` file is set, run `cp env_example .env`

To start the slim setup (only blockchain, api, frontend), run `bash start-trubudget.sh` or `bash start-trubudget.sh --slim`.

To start 2 slim TruBudget instances for 2 organizations, run `bash start-dev.sh --slim --add-organization`.

To start the full setup, run `bash start-trubudget.sh --full`.

For further information, run `bash start-trubudget.sh --help`.

When the setup has completed, you can open these URLs in the browser:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000/

API: http://localhost:8080/api/documentation/static/index.html

### Setup with two organizations

To learn how to setup TruBudget with multiple organizations and how tho connect them, see the documentation of [Connect to an existing network](../../docs/operation-administration/installation/connect-to-an-existing-network/docker.md)

### Environment Variables

The environmental variables are located in the file `.env` (in the directory `scripts/operation/`). You can change them directly. If you do not have an `.env` file, you can copy the `.env_example` file.
