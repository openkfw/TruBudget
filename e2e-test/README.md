# End-to-end Tests

This folder contains end-to-end tests which test the whole functionality of the application.

For the setup of the e2e-tests please visit the [Developer Setup](../docs/developer/developer-setup.md#tests)

## Environment Variables

In general, Cypress loads each OS environment variable prefixed with \_CYPRESS\_\_ to be accessible in the code with `Cypress.env`. When defined, they will overrides equivalent variables in the configuration file `cypress.json`. See [Cypress documentation for enviroment variables setting](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Setting) and [Cypress configuration options](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.html#Options) for more details.

Variables after \_CYPRESS\_\_ prefix can have either camel case or screaming snake case notation. For example, both definitions are equivalent:

```
CYPRESS_baseUrl=http://localhost:3000
```

```
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Those variables can be set in `.env` file also. `.env_example` file is prepared for easy creation (see Developer guide: [Environment variables](../docs/developer/developer-setup.md#environment-variables)). Thanks _cypress-dotenv_ module they can be available in the code. They have the same meaning like its Run Command Arguments conterparts.

| Env Variable Name               | Default Value         | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| CYPRESS_BASE_URL                | http://localhost:3000 | The address of the frontend service.              |
| CYPRESS_API_BASE_URL            | http://localhost:8080 | The address of the api production environment     |
| CYPRESS_EXPORT_SERVICE_BASE_URL | http://localhost:8888 | The address of the excel export service           |
| CYPRESS_ROOT_SECRET             | root-secret           | The Password of the root user, for some api calls |

Note: Do NOT use other additional ways to set environment variables like inline env-variables or env-variables defined by 'export'. Why? - Because these env-variables will overwrite each which makes it very hard to find mistakes.

### Definition Precedense

The evaluation priority of a variable is determined by the on place of its definition:

1. `.env` file (**Recommended** - see Developer guide: [Environment variables](../docs/developer/developer-setup.md#environment-variables))
2. Arguments of the `npm run cypress` or `npm run e2etest` command
3. Operating system environment (defined e.g. with `export` command)
4. Values from the configuration file - `cypress.json` (if exists)

As 1. has the highest priority, 4. the lowest. Order between 3. and 4. is defined by test implementation.

## Run Command Arguments

Following variables are used with connection with command `npm run e2etest` or `npm run cypress`:

| Name                    | Default Value              | Command Line Switch | Description                                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| baseUrl                 | http://localhost:3000      | env                 | The address of the frontend service.          |
| API_BASE_URL            | http://localhost:8080      | env                 | The address of the api production environment |
| EXPORT_SERVICE_BASE_URL | baseUrl + /api/export/xlsx | env                 | The address of the excel export service       |
| ROOT_SECRET             | not set                    | env                 | Password of the root user, for some api calls |

Note: The only difference between those two commands is `npm run cypress` opens GUI for interaction mode. Obviously, the _spec_ option has no sense in this case.

## Local Run

This section describes how we can run and debug the tests locally with Cypress.

### Prerequisits

Setup a provisioned Trubudget node including the excel-export service. Check out the [Developer Setup](../docs/developer/developer-setup.md) for more details.
The easiest way to start a provisioned Trubudget node is to start it via developer script

```bash
bash scripts/development/start-dev.sh --full
```

Install all required libraries and unset DISPLAY env var (necessary for ubuntu/WSL2)

```bash
apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb
unset DISPLAY
```

:::note
If you are using WSL on Windows check out [this setup](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/gui-on-wsl2-cypress) to run cypress in WSL.
:::

Navigate to the `e2e-test` folder and generate the `.env` file. If needed modify the .env file.

```bash
cd e2e-test
cp .env_example .env
```

### Start E2E-Tests via Cypress

After a provisioned trubudget node is setup and cypress is working as expected the e2e-tests can be started.

:::info
Make sure following commands are executed from the `e2e-test` directory.
:::

#### Cypress GUI

Start the `Cypress GUI` to list and be able to execute and follow each test individually.

```bash
npm run cypress
```

#### Command-line

Start and follow all e2e-tests on `command line`.

```bash
npm run e2etest
```

#### Specific tests via command-line

Start a specific test immediately:

```bash
npm run e2etest -- --spec **/currencies_spec.js
```

### Run Cypress GUI in Docker

Showing the GUI of cypress which is running in a docker container is an advanced process that needs additional software (XQuartz) for Windows and Mac. Furthermore, Cypress does not recommend using Cypress in Docker (or Docker-Compose) except if you are working without NodeJS (like Python or GO).
