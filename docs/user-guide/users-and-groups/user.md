# User

With **Users** an organization can grant an entity access to the Trubudget-application. New users only have access to the Trubudget-application without permissions to see any project. All permissions (e.g. view a project, view a subproject,...) have to be granted separately by the administrator. More details about the permission model can be found in the [Permissions section](./permissions.md)

Users and Groups can be viewed and created in the "Users" section which can be found in the sidebar navigation.

## Change a user's password

**Description:**
A user's password can be changed by anyone who has the permission `user.changePassword` for a given user. Starting with version `v1.1.0` every user is granted the permission to change his/her own password upon creation . If another user should be able to change a user's password (like an administrator), this permission needs to be granted via the `/users.intent.grantPermission` endpoint. The `root` user can always change passwords and grant the necessary permissions.

Examples:

- User `Portfoliomanager` wants to change his own password, but does not have the permission to do so. The `root` user needs to grant `Portfoliomanager` the permission `user.changePassword`. Once this is done, `Portfoliomanager` can change his own password.
- User `Portfoliomanager` is an administrator and should be able to change the password of `Portfolioanalyst`. The `root` user needs to grant the `user.changePassword` permission to `Portfoliomanager` for `Portfolioanalyst`. After that, `Portfoliomanager` is able to change the password of `Portfolioanalyst`.

**Instructions:**

1. Click the button in the upper left corner (hamburger menu) to open the side-navigation-bar
2. Click "Users" Selection
3. Click the "Edit" button (looks like a pen) next to the user you want to change the password for
4. Type in _your_ password
5. Type in the new password for the selected user
6. Re-type the new password to confirm it
7. Click "Submit" to save the new password

:::note
To change a user's password, you must type in _your_ password first
