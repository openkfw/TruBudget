The variable is forwarded to the multichain daemon as `externalip` argument. This will be reported to other nodes in the Trubudget network. By default, daemon will try to automatically detect an external IP address. However, this might not always be accurate, especially if a node is behind a NAT or a firewall. By using EXTERNAL_IP, you can manually specify the IP. This can be useful if you want to ensure that your node is reachable at a specific address. If your node is not actually reachable at the specified IP address (e.g. because of a firewall), other nodes might not be able to connect to it.  Example: If you have a VM running on 22.22.22.22 and you want to start a beta node from this VM to connect to an alpha running on 11.11.11.11, you set `EXTERNAL_IP` to 11.11.11.11 on alpha node and 22.22.22.22 on beta node.  |
