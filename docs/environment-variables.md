This environment variable sets this organization name. It is used to create the organization stream on the blockchain and is also displayed in the frontend's top right corner.                                                                                                                                   |

If you want to add a new node for your organization, you want users to be able to log in on either node. Make sure that the api connected to the new node has the same organization vault secret.<br/>**Caution:** If you want to run TruBudget in production,make sure NOT to use the default value from the `.env_example` file! |

Example: If you run TruBudget locally and set API_PORT to `8080`, you can reach the API via `localhost:8080/api`. For Blockchain, this is the backup download port.                                                                                                                                                     |

If you start with an empty blockchain, the root user is needed to add other users, approve new nodes,.. If you don't set a value via the environment variable, the API generates one randomly and prints it to the console<br/>**Caution:** If you want to run TruBudget in production, make sure to set a secure root secret.               |
| RPC_PASSWORD                       | no       | [hardcoded]                                       | api/bc               | Password used by the API to connect to the blockchain. The password is set by the origin node upon start. Every slave node needs to use the same RPC password in order to be able to connect to the blockchain.<br/>**Hint:** Although the RPC_PASSWORD is not required it is highly recommended to set an own secure one                                                                       |
