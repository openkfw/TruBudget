This environment variable sets this organization name. It is used to create the organization stream on the blockchain and is also displayed in the frontend's top right corner.                                                                                                                                   |

If you want to add a new node for your organization, you want users to be able to log in on either node. Make sure that the api connected to the new node has the same organization vault secret.<br/>**Caution:** If you want to run TruBudget in production,make sure NOT to use the default value from the `.env_example` file! |

Example: If you run TruBudget locally and set API_PORT to `8080`, you can reach the API via `localhost:8080/api`.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

If you start with an empty blockchain, the root user is needed to add other users, approve new nodes,.. If you don't set a value via the environment variable, the API generates one randomly and prints it to the console<br/>**Caution:** If you want to run TruBudget in production, make sure to set a secure root secret.               |
| BLOCKCHAIN_PORT                    | no       | 8085                              | api/bc               | The Port of the blockchain where the server is available for incoming http connections (e.g. readiness, versions, backup and restore)

The password is set by the origin node upon start. Every beta node needs to use the same RPC password in order to be able to connect to the blockchain.<br/>**Hint:** Although the MULTICHAIN_RPC_PASSWORD is not required it is highly recommended to set an own secure one                                                             |
