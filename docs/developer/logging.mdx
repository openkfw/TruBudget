## Frontend Logging

TruBudget offers the possibility to log frontend events such as errors or crashes. To collect and store this data, the TruBudget logging-service must be enabled.
To enable the TruBudget logging-service, the parameter `--with-frotnend-logging` must be passed when deploying or when starting TruBudget in development mode with the provided start script.
Make sure all env variables are set correctly as defined [in the environment description](./../enviroment-variables.md).
