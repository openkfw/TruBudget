# Connect to an existing Blockchain network using docker

This guide describes how to connect to an existing network using of Docker and Docker Compose.
Before starting make sure to have docker and docker compose available on your machine.

## Trubudget Docker Images

Trubudget's docker images are published on [docker-hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/trubudget).
It is recommended to use a specific version tag like v.1.20.0 instead of the main or latest tag.

>Only use main or latest tag if a code change of these versions is needed.

## Blockchain

A `beta node` is a Trubudget node which connects to an existing Trubudget network.
To understand the connection process read the [approval process documentation](./connection-process.md).

### Environment Variables

To establish a connection to an existing Trubudget network following conditions must be met:

1. For a description of all Environment variables, see [environment variables](../../../environment-variables.md).
   This table gives an overview how to set the env vars correctly, so the beta node can connect to the alpha node.
   Empty entries mean that setting that env var has no effect.

| Env Var Name | Description | Alpha API  | Alpha Blockchain | Beta API | Beta Blockchain  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXTERNAL_IP  |   IP address with which the current node can be reached.    |        Not relevant         |       Should be set if nodes are not in the same network.        | Not relevant | Should be set if nodes are not in the same network. |

### Example setup
You can see an example multi-node setup via docker-compose under `/docker-compose/multi-node`. Check out the container env variable setup in `docker-compose.yml` to have a better idea how they are used differently in alpha and beta services.
